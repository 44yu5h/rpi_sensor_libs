# Sensor library for RPi OS

The `rpi.py` and `sensors` folder is supposed to be copied to `pythonx.xx/site-packages` and then can be normally and globally imported and used.

The repo has functions for:
 - Digital output
 - Digital input
 - PWM output
 - Delay
 - Button
 - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic distance sensor
 - DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
 - OLED display
 - Servo Motor

 All the function is supposed to be called and defined in `rpi.py` so that the usage becomes easier

# Usage

`import rpi` and then proceed to use any function that suits the need.
